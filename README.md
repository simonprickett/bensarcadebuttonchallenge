Ben's Arcade Button Challenge
=============================

I will flesh this out some more, this repo is for a small HTML / JavaScript / CSS game that my 12 year old son and I built together one evening.

We wired up some arcade buttons to an iPac keyboard controller, and used that to send keypresses into the browser.

Ben made some videos throughout the process:

* Stage 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuW-ze8U67I

The code's still pretty rough and ready, but it's functional!
