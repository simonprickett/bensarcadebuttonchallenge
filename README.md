Ben's Arcade Button Challenge
=============================

I will flesh this out some more, this repo is for a small HTML / JavaScript / CSS game that my 12 year old son and I built together one evening.

We wired up some arcade buttons to an iPac keyboard controller, and used that to send keypresses into the browser.

Ben made some videos throughout the process:

* Stage 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQwKmig882I
* Stage 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQJW1GmTgk0
* Stage 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuW-ze8U67I
* Stage 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USdqAjKv9g0
* Stage 6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUzdZciXW98

The code's still pretty rough and ready, but it's functional!

I hosted a copy here (use keys 1 and 2 in lieu of the arcade buttons we're using):

This uses some [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) goodness.
